# What is this ?
All the files of MamiesModGecko, a .NET framework library for connect your Wii U to your PC.    
It is made to be used with the [BullyWiiPlaza's TCP Gecko](https://github.com/BullyWiiPlaza/tcpgecko) or other applications derived from this such as [MamiesMod Wii U](https://github.com/nt-games-ytb/MamiesMod-Wii-U).    
The repositorie contain also MamiesModGeckoTest, a simple RTM Tool exemple which uses MamiesModGecko.    
the files are named as follows "year month day".    
This library is used especially in MamiesMod V2 and V3 (not in MamiesMod V4 and Mobile).    

# How I can use it ?
You can use it on a Csharp projet, in adding files to the projects or you can use MamiesModGeckoTest to create your real time to modding tool.
